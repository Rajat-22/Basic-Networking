# Basic-Networking
This project is based on basic networking.

I have created a Report file on my project which I shared among all.
In this report file I have explain the concept of some basic networking.These concepts are -
1. Web Server
2. DNS Server
3. Mail Server
4. DHCP Server
5. Samba
6. Partition and Quota
7. Firewall

Simply, I created a webserver and DNS Server and hosted it in my lan practically then I created mail server for the webserver. In that mail server I apply DHCP Server and Samba.
After that I partition in the server and give Quota to the chairman and finally apply some firewall on the webserver.
For more detail check the document file there i explain the project in detail.
